# Developer_test_Thales
Developer test's solution from Thales 

1. The application was created in vscode, using Spring Boot 3.4.3 and Java 17, React with node.js v22.14.0.
2. The war file was shared to the recruiter, although it also can be found on the target folder of this published application.
3. The application can be diploid in Spring boot itself, thereÂ´s no need to use an external server.
4. To execute the application download the war file that is in the target folder, leave it on a local folder, open vscode and using the terminal step on the folder you saved the war file, 
then execute the next command java -jar employee-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war. Then access to the browser and type http://localhost:9090/ It should work now, but if for any reason it's not working
it can be due two possible things: a. the port is already in use, so kill the process that is using the port. b. The application might be not recognizing the url try with this instead
http://localhost:9090/index.html.
5. If you need to download the whole project and run it, just consider the versions I used to built the app.
